# Prompts Used

Records of prompts used during app development with the AI coding assistant.

---

## Prompt 1 — Initial Project Brief

> Design and build a web application that enables users to: (1) submit a form capturing feature goal, target users, and constraints; (2) generate a structured list of user stories and engineering tasks based on that input; (3) manipulate the generated tasks through editing, reordering, and grouping; (4) export results in text or markdown format; (5) display the 5 most recent specifications generated by the user.
>
> The application should include:
> - User stories in format: "As a [user type], I want [feature] so that [benefit]"
> - Engineering tasks in format: "[Component]: [Action] [Description]"
> - All tasks stored using local storage
> - Pre-built templates: Mobile (iOS/Android testing, app store), Web (browser compat, SEO, CDN), Internal Tool (permissions, audit logging, admin dashboard)
> - A "Risks & Unknowns" section
> - Task grouping by type, priority, component, or phase
> - Export preserving grouping and formatting
> - Store last 5 generated specs in local storage
> - Inline editing of title, description, and metadata

## Prompt 2 — Tech Stack Migration

> Migrate the project from vanilla HTML/CSS/JS to a modern framework stack:
> - **Runtime**: React.js with Node.js tooling
> - **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first design
>
> Ensure all existing features and planned architecture carry over to the new stack.

## Prompt 3 — Export Modal UX Fix

> **Issue**: The export modal renders below the visible viewport, requiring the user to scroll down to interact with it.
>
> **Expected behavior**: The modal should appear centered and fixed within the viewport overlay, visible immediately upon clicking the Export button regardless of the current scroll position.

## Prompt 4 — Project Documentation Suite

> Generate the following documentation files at the project root:
> - **README.md**: Setup instructions (how to install and run), and a summary of implemented features.
> - **AI_NOTES.md**: Document which parts of development used AI assistance, which parts were manually verified, and specify the LLM/provider used at runtime (if any) with rationale.
> - **ABOUTME.md**: Placeholder for developer name and resume.
> - **PROMPTS_USED.md**: Chronological log of all prompts used during development, excluding agent responses and API keys.

## Prompt 5 — Docker Containerization

> Evaluate and configure Docker support for the project so it can be cloned from GitHub and run inside a Docker container. Add all necessary configuration files (`Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`) following best practices for a Node.js/React production build.

## Prompt 6 — Prompt Log Update

> Append the Docker containerization prompt (Prompt 5) to the `PROMPTS_USED.md` file to maintain a complete development log.

## Prompt 7 — GitHub Deployment

> Initialize a Git repository, commit all project files, and push to the remote repository at:
> `https://github.com/Prakashsuriya/SpecFlow.git`
>
> Ensure `node_modules` and build artifacts are excluded via `.gitignore`.

## Prompt 8 — Vercel Hosting

> Provide deployment instructions for hosting the application on Vercel, leveraging the existing GitHub repository integration for automated builds and previews.

## Prompt 9 — ABOUTME.md Update

> Replace the placeholder resume content in `ABOUTME.md` with a link to the developer's resume hosted on Google Drive:
> `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UyaLoTJeGChFZQjE86lK0j4vtNAPMkZW/view?usp=sharing`


## Prompt 10 — README Enhancement & Deployment Details

> Add the deployed Vercel link (`https://spec-flow-navy.vercel.app/`) to the README. Include sections for deployment details, GitHub repository link, and comprehensive instructions for running the project locally and via Docker. Update `PROMPTS_USED.md` to include this prompt.

## Prompt 11 — Prompt Log Consolidation

> Audit the `PROMPTS_USED.md` file and ensure all prompts from the development session are captured in chronological order with correct sequential numbering. Refine prompt descriptions for clarity and professional presentation while preserving the original intent of each prompt.
