# Prompts Used

Records of prompts used during app development with the AI coding assistant.

---

## Prompt 1 — Initial Project Brief

> Design and build a web application that enables users to: (1) submit a form capturing feature goal, target users, and constraints; (2) generate a structured list of user stories and engineering tasks based on that input; (3) manipulate the generated tasks through editing, reordering, and grouping; (4) export results in text or markdown format; (5) display the 5 most recent specifications generated by the user.
>
> The application should include:
> - User stories in format: "As a [user type], I want [feature] so that [benefit]"
> - Engineering tasks in format: "[Component]: [Action] [Description]"
> - All tasks stored using local storage
> - Pre-built templates: Mobile (iOS/Android testing, app store), Web (browser compat, SEO, CDN), Internal Tool (permissions, audit logging, admin dashboard)
> - A "Risks & Unknowns" section
> - Task grouping by type, priority, component, or phase
> - Export preserving grouping and formatting
> - Store last 5 generated specs in local storage
> - Inline editing of title, description, and metadata

## Prompt 2 — Export Modal Fix

> When I click the export button this window is not appearing on top, I have to scroll down to see it, but I want it to appear on the top itself.

## Prompt 3 — Documentation

> A short README: how to run, what is done.
> A short AI_NOTES.md: what you used AI for, and what you checked yourself. Which LLM and provider does your app use and why.
> Put your name and resume in ABOUTME.md.
> A PROMPTS_USED.md, with records of your prompts used for app development.

## Prompt 5 — Docker Support

> If I push this project to my GitHub repo, will this project work/run in Docker?
